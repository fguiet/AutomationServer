# SynchronizeTime: if you want to set time from computer to phone during

# Logfile        : Use, when want to have logfile from communication.
# Logformat      : What debug info and format should be used:
#                  "nothing" - no debug level, "text" - transmission dump in
#                  text format, "textall" - all possible info in text format,
